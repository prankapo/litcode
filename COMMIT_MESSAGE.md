LitCode v0.01 - Initial Commit  

- New: bootstrap/
        * Contains code responsible for tangling tangling and weaving programs out of their documentation.
        * litcode.py: Responsible for reading all `.tex` files in a directory, and tangling the specified chunk
        out of them.  
        * build.sh: Running it makes litcode.py a Python script which can be run as it is from the shell without 
        invoking python3.  
        * scratch.py: Contains ideas on how tangling can be done out of `.tex` files.
- New: documentation/
        * Contains LaTeX documents providing a structure of how the documentation would be written.
